# Milestone 1: Service with Minimum Features

## System Description

### Overview

Given text, the system would tell the user if there is a match or not in the database.
The database consists of tens of to hundreds of songs, both the raw audio data and the description are stored.
Desktop application.

### Detail

We apply Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure to our system.

__Database__ as model
```
id: data identifier
music: original audio
meta description: song, album, artist, genre, year
audio description: length
```

__User Interface__ as view
```
_upload music_: analyze music and get description, save the music and description into **Database**, tell **User Interface** weâ€™re done.
_query by text_: compare text with description in **Database**, return result to **User Interface**
_result_: music, description, (more actions applying to the result)
_play audio_: as the name suggested.
```

__Algorithms__ as controller
```
_analyze music_:
* input = audio clip / music. Might have different file format, different sample rate, different bit depth, mono/stereo, etc.
* output = formatted description

_save music and description_:
* input = music
* output = none, but music and its description are stored in **Database**

_text compare_:
* input = text
* output = T/F or list of ranking, with corresponding music

_description compare_:
* input = description
* output = T/F or list of ranking, with corresponding music
```
